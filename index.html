<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qingfengxia/CAE_pipeline/master/images/current_CAE_process.png" alt="schematic" /> This schematic of the current time-consuming and the proposed future intelligent engineering design can be found: <a href="https://github.com/qingfengxia/CAE_pipeline" class="uri">https://github.com/qingfengxia/CAE_pipeline</a></p>
<p>To enable intelligent engineering design, I (Qingfeng Xia) have initiated several sub-projects on github since 2016.</p>
<h2 id="currently-active-sub-projects">2. Currently active sub-projects</h2>
<h3 id="cad-freecad">2.1 CAD: FreeCAD</h3>
<h3 id="geometry-pre-processing">Geometry pre-processing</h3>
<p>During my employment in UKAEA, I design a “parallel preprocessor” to pre-process large assemblies (tens of thousands parts) to enable meshing and simulation. It is designed to use both MPI and multi-threading parallelism; this software will be open source very soon. Independently, I will dive into the research problem of geometry recognition using machine learning.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-meshing">2.3 Parallel meshing</h3>
<p>It is expected third-party meshing tools will be used, while “parallel pre-processor” will make a parallel meshing framework to accelerate meshing large assemblies (underway). <a href="">MOAB</a> is a library to import mesh from various meshing tools and export meshing for different solvers.</p>
<h3 id="solver-input-openfoam">2.4. Solver input: OpenFOAM</h3>
<p>I developed a <a href="https://github.com/qingfengxia/Cfd">CFD module (using OpenFOAM solver) for FreeCAD</a>, to enable one-stop design and simulation, with the topology optimization capacity. There is a independent module inside this CFD module, <a href=""><em>FoamCaseBuilder</em></a>, aiming at simulation automation.</p>

<p>C++ code is merged to Fem module <a href="https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD.git" class="uri">https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD.git</a>, while python code is developed as an independent module: <a href="https://github.com/qingfengxia/Cfd" class="uri">https://github.com/qingfengxia/Cfd</a></p>
<h3 id="multiphysics-solver-fenicssolver">2.5 Multiphysics Solver: <a href="https://github.com/qingfengxia/FenicsSolver">FenicsSolver</a></h3>
<p>This is a multiphysics FEM solver based on Fenics. Currently, I am working on coupling Fenics with OpenFOAM, etc. See my presentation on [OpenFOAM workshop 2018])https://www.iesensor.com/blog/2018/06/25/coupling-openfoam-with-fenics-for-multiphysis-simulation-openfoam-workshop-13-presentation/)</p>
<h3 id="solver-coupling">2.6 Solver coupling:</h3>
<p>To coupling and coordinate different physical model solvers.</p>
<h3 id="post-processing">2.7 Post processing</h3>
<p>Currently, VTK and <strong>Paraview</strong> is sufficient is support the engineering design pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="report-optimization-and-machine-learning">2.8 Report, optimization and machine learning</h3>
<p>This work will start once the research in intelligent preprocessing reaches mature.</p>
