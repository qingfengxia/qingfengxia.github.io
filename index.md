## currently active projects
- OpenFOAM for FreeCAD
         C++ code is merged to Fem module <https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD.git>, 
         while python code is develoed as an independent module: <https://github.com/qingfengxia/Cfd>


- ebook: *Module developer's Guide to FreeCAD* <https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide>

- Multiphysics FEM solver based on Fenics: FenicsSolver
          <https://github.com/qingfengxia/FenicsSolver>
          currently, I am working on coupling Fenics with OpenFOAM, 
          see  my presentation on OpenFOAM workshop 2018 <https://www.iesensor.com/blog/2018/06/25/coupling-openfoam-with-fenics-for-multiphysis-simulation-openfoam-workshop-13-presentation/>
