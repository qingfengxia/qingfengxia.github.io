# Introduction to C++

## what is C++

Object oriented (OO) version of C, "C with [Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(programming))"

A superset of C

but not the only extension of C:  objective-C, D, etc.

---
### then what is C language?
 C is born with Unix OS from Bell lab in early 1970s.

Nowadays, most operation systems (OS) is written in C, Linux kernel

Many high level language runtime are written in C(Python)/C++(javascript)

Unique: Pointer (address to raw memory space) and full control memory

Power: assembly language can be embedded into C code

---
### C++ features over C
+ object oriented paradigm
+ generic programming by template  `std::vector<int> ints;`
+ `namespace` to avoid name clash
+ functional programming, `std::fuction, lambda`
+ exception (try-catch-finally)
+ RTTI: runtime type information, but not as powerful as Java/C#

---

## why C/C++ (pros)
+ fundamental: operation system, device driver
+ performance: compiling language as Fortran
+ versatile: Object-orientation, template/generalized, functional
+ vast third-party libraries
+ shared feature with C family languages: C#, Java, Objective-C, etc

+ suitable for large scale software design, HPC
e.g. CFD software Ansys Fluent from Fortran to C++
---
### Popularity of C and C++
<img src="./assets/tiobe_lang_rank_2019.png" width=75%>

The combination of C and C++ takes the lead in Tiobe rankings.

---

### C++ standards
+ C++ invented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985
+ the firs standard C++ 98,  standard library (STL) was not available
+ C++11 (modern C++) and C++17/C++20 have some exciting/modern features
  - `std::thread`, `std::function`, `lambda`, `std::tuple`, smart pointers
  - `filesystem`(C++17), traits

+ some can not wait for a better C++: *rust, go* are invented before C++11 published

---

## why not C++ (Cons)

+ C++ grammar is too complicate
 - confusing keyword `using` and `static`
 - too many integer types, java has only unsigned types with fixed ranges
 - pointer, reference
 - polymorphic only apply to pointer/reference
 - no memory manager/garbage collector

+ less featured standard libraries, vs. python, Java, C#, etc
  however, C++ has lib and frameworks like boost, Qt

+ less productivity:
    on average, 50 lines of production code
   [The Programmer Productivity Paradox ](https://dzone.com/articles/programmer-productivity)

## try out using c++ online compilers
There is a list of online compiler to try C++ in webbrowser

<https://arnemertz.github.io/online-compilers/>

Cppinsights: see how compiler do the compiling
<repl.it>: can save user's code snippet, as it is used in this lesseon

# Safer computation in C++

## How crucial is the research software

## the jungle of integer types

```cpp
//signed
char
short
int
long
long long
// and with their unsigned version
```
What is the size (in byte, unit of memory capacity) of `int` and `long` do you think?

<a href="https://repl.it/@qingfengxia/printcpptypesize">run example by online compiler</a>



---

### C++'s integer types depends on CPU, OS, even compiler

```cpp
// here we only consider 32 and 64bit OS
void*  // identifed from memory address pointer byte size
//signed and unsigned integer has the same length
char 1 byte
short  2 bytes
int     4 bytes
long   depends on OS, compiler settings
long long  8bytes
```
windows 64 bit, has `long` just 4 bytes, while on Linux 64 bit OS,  it is 8 bytes 

`size_t` returned by `sizeof` operator and  `std::vector.size()`, it is 64 bits on both `uint64_t` on 64 bit windows and Linux system, while 32 bit unsigned integer

---

### fixed width integer types in C and C++

**Java and C# has fixed byte size for integer type cross-platform!**

header `<cstdint>` has fixed width integer types,  `uint32_t` `int64_t` 

---

### numeric type in matlab

![Image result for numeric type in matlab](assets/matlab_numeric_types.png)

matlab `a = 1.0`   default to double type,  as C++ python, etc

---
### numeric types in other programming languages

| language               | C/C++           | Fortran         | Java            | javascript      | C#              | python3   | Matlab |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------ |
| type                   | int             | integer         | int             | Number          | int             | int       | double |
| upper and lower limits | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | -2^53 to 2^53-1 | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | unlimited |        |
| byte in memory         | 4               | 4 (KIND=4)      | fixed 4         | 8               | fixed 4         | >=24      | >=8    |

---
### deal with algorithm overflow

<https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/convert-unsigned-int-to-signed-int>

```cpp
#include <limits>    // for std::numeric_limits
#include <stdexcept> // for std::overflow_error

int SizeToInt(size_t u)
{
    if (u > std::numeric_limits<int>::max())
    {
        throw std::overflow_error(
            "size_t value cannot be stored in a variable of type int.");
    }

    return static_cast<int>(u);
}
```
---
## float point number type 

### decimal vs floating point

+ *decimal* in Python/Java,  precisely map to human counting system, order=10

+ float point, is based on binary system, maybe not precise to represent *decimal*#

---

---

### float point number types 

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format>,
IEEE754-2008 standard

- 16bit `half` precision, widely used in GPU

- 32bit single precision, `float`, at least 9 significant digits

- 64bit `double` precision, `double` for short in  C/C++

- 128-bit: Quadruple (binary128), barely any CPU support this natively

- `long double` depends on compiler implementation

  `double`  is a common primitive type in programming languages

---

## Implicit conversion (1) C language features
### dangerous integer type implicit conversion

It is crucial to know the types of your programming languages!

```cpp
void std_container_index_test(){
    std::vector<int> v;
    int index= 10;
    if (index < v.size()-1) // there is a compiler warning here
        std::cout << v[index];
}
```

<a href="https://repl.it/@qingfengxia/stdcontainerindextest"> run examle by online compiler</a>

---
### algorithmic promotion

+ safe from smaller type (smaller in byte size, range) to bigger type
   from `char -> short -> int ->long -> long long`
   from `unsigned int -> signed long long`

+ from `half->float->double->long double`

+ same width: `signed int -> unsigned int`, it is potentially dangerous!

   see example code in later section

+ `enum` is `int` if the underlying type is not explicitly specified

   see more details: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Integral_promotion>

---
### numerical conversion
+ if there is no rule for promotion, it is an conversion
   -  e.g. floating–integral conversions
   - The programmer need to care about out of range, loss of precision

+ mixing of signed and unsigned integer of size byte size

  from `signed int -> unsigned long long`

```cpp
      int n = -1;
      unsigned int u = 1;
      std::cout << "Comparing signed and unsigned:\n"
                << " -1  < 1? " << (n < u) << '\n'
                << " -1  > 1? " << (n > u) << '\n';
```

  see example <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_comparison>

---


## implicit conversion (2) C++ object oriented


### implicitly cast to base/parent type pointer/reference

this is the polymorphic, the essence of object oriented programming

Pointer conversions:
   from a type pointer to `void`,

   from `nullptr` to any type pointer

  function name to function pointer

  array name to pointer

---

### if constructor with single parameter exists

```cpp
const char* c_string = "hello world";
std::string s = c_string;
```

it leads to the question of function overloading priority

---
### function overloading resolution

todo!

---

## prevent implicit conversion (1)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
class A {
    bool b;
public:
	A(bool param)  // use `explicit` to see the difference
    { std::cout<<"bool actor called with param =" << param << std::endl; }
    explicit  operator bool() {return b;};
};
int main(){
    A a = A(1);  // int -> bool, no compiler warning, but maybe not what you want
    A b(2.3); // double -> bool, no compiler warning, but maybe not what you want
    A c = true;  // compiler error if the constructure is protected by `explicit`
    A d = 1.5;  // compiler error if the constructure is protected by `explicit`
}
```

C++ keyword `explicit` can prevent implicit conversion on constructor

---

### prevent implicit conversion (2)

1. explicit way for one specific type

```cpp
void function(int i) { /* implementation */}
void function(char i); // give link error, this declaration has no implementation
//or, in C++11
void function(char i) = delete;
```

**2. You cannot have implicit conversion and template argument deduction at the same time.**

```cpp
template<class T> void f(T, T);
template<class T> void g(T, std::type_identity_t<T>);
f(4.2, 0); // error, deduced conflicting types for 'T'
g(4.2, 0); // OK, calls g<double>, bypass this restriction and enable implicit conversion
```

3. `nothing_but<>`  can handled all builtin types

---
### explicit cast in C++

`static_cast<T>`  conversion at compiling time, safer

```cpp
    double d = 123456.789;
    float f = static_cast<float>(d);
    // silly, I messed up the value type and pointer type
    float* pf = static_cast<float*>(d);
```

`dynamic_cast<T>` conversion at runtime
`const_cast<T>`
`any_cast<T>`  from `std::any` unbox to more specific type
`reinterpret_cast<>`  dangerous! do not use!

---
## boolean conversion

+ a wide range of types in C++ can implicitly converted into bool type

  nullptr-> false;   0.0 -> false;

+ from bool to integer is well defined
  
  - bool to int: true => 1, false => 0
  - if a type can be converted into bool, but further conversion into integer should be forbidden
    e.g. `if(std::cin) {...}` is wanted, but `int n = std::cout;` must be avoided, then
    `explicit operator bool() const { ... }`


---

### surprising conversion from pointer to bool

```cpp
void foo(const std::string& in) { std::cout << in << '\n'; }
void foo(bool in) { std::cout << "bool: " << in << '\n';}

foo("Hello World");
```

see explanation <https://www.bfilipek.com/2019/07/surprising-conversions-char-bool.html#more>

In short,  it is caused by auto conversion rule of C++,

conversion from `const char*` to bool has higher priority because bool is a built-in type!


---
## Exception safety

4 levels of exception safety

+ ideal: no failure
+ strong: failure but rollback to previous condition, think about online banking transaction
+ basic: failure without resource leakage, important for server process
+ none: no guarantee, left program in a deterministic condition

There books/guidelines on write exception safety C++ code,

[C++ core guideline on exception](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#S-errors)



---

### some guideline from [SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88046682)

[ERR54-CPP. Catch handlers should order their parameter types from most derived to least derived](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/ERR54-CPP.+Catch+handlers+should+order+their+parameter+types+from+most+derived+to+least+derived)

do you know why?

---
### exception change in C++11 and C++17

C++98:  defined a few standard exceptions in `<stdexception>` use then instead of throw int or string

  they are all derived from `std::exception` so it is easier to catch all derived exceptions

  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception

C++11:  `current_exception` pointer, `nested_exception`

c++17:   exception specification changed,

 ` f() noexception(false)` instead of  `f() throw(std::logical_error)`

---
## exception/error in math computation

### integer underflow/overflow

- CPU set status register, which may be checked by C and C++

- C lib: `errno` set and clear by library function

  <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Errors-in-Math-Functions.html>

  <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/errno>

- C++ way to detect under/overflow

Note: know and detect your integer range in runtime

C has `LONG_MAX` macro, c++ has more general one `std::limits<long>::max()`

---

### float point exception and special values

Divied by zero (float point types)might be blocked by compiler at compiling time.

NaN,  +Inf, -Inf

```c
    printf("sqrt(-1) = %f\n", sqrt(-1));
    printf("DBL_MAX*2.0 = %f\n", DBL_MAX*2.0);
    printf("DBL_MAX*-2.0 = %f\n", DBL_MAX*-2.0);
```

those 3 special values operates with a valid number resulting in those special values

---

### setup float point exception check in C++

This is a C99 feature in header  `<cfenv>`

```cpp
    if(fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO)) printf(" FE_DIVBYZERO");
    if(fetestexcept(FE_INEXACT))   printf(" FE_INEXACT");
    if(fetestexcept(FE_INVALID))   printf(" FE_INVALID");
    if(fetestexcept(FE_OVERFLOW))  printf(" FE_OVERFLOW");
    if(fetestexcept(FE_UNDERFLOW)) printf(" FE_UNDERFLOW");
    feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
```

<https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/fenv/FE_exceptions>

---

## diagnostics tools to improve code safety

+ [Clang Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-690586.ClangPowerTools), turn on compiler's all warning switches
+ cppchecker, lint, some other linting/checker tools
+ [SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88046682), online reading

+ C++ Core guidelines checker (a plugin of visual studio)
+ etc.

---
# design large scale software

## Software architecture
```cpp
// the software is like a house
// namespace as component contains more classes
namespace FrontWall{
    class Block {
        function makeBrick(){
        	int sand = 1; ... }
```

### stand on giant shoulder
[awesome C++](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp)    [awesome modern C++](https://github.com/rigtorp/awesome-modern-cpp)

+ libraries

+ learning material, video, blogs, books, talks conferences

+ useful tools: IDE, profilers, build, package and code analyzer

---
### design pattern

---
### Base class and type system for C++
Compared with other compiling languages like C# and Java, C++ does not provide  a type system, neither a base class. Here is an implementation, extracted from FreeCAD project
<https://github.com/qingfengxia/cppBase>

There is no need to write factory class, but register a type by simple macro
(only achievable by macro).
```cpp
    Base::BaseClass* bc = static_cast<Base::BaseClass*>(Base::Type::createInstanceByName("CClass"));
    CClass* c2 = type_dynamic_cast<CClass>(bc);
```
see the full example <https://github.com/qingfengxia/cppBase/blob/master/TypeTest.cpp>

---
## C++ and Python

### python and C++ are good companions
  python is an interpreter lang, for fast prototyping
  C++ codes run fast for large program and HPC

  a few CPython standard modules are re-written in C/C++ for better perfomance
  There are various methods to export C++ API as python module.
  see more example and cmake/setup.py integration at

 <https://github.com/qingfengxia/python_wrap>

---

### Wrapping C++ code to other languages

`swig` can wrap C/C++ to many languages, C#, Java, javascript, python, ruby, etc
using the `interface.i` file

---

### `numba` JIT example
```python
from numba import jit
@jit
def create_fractal(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, image, iters):
    height = image.shape[0]
    width = image.shape[1]

    pixel_size_x = (max_x - min_x) / width
    pixel_size_y = (max_y - min_y) / height
    for x in range(width):
        real = min_x + x * pixel_size_x
        for y in range(height):
            imag = min_y + y * pixel_size_y
            color = mandel(real, imag, iters)
            image[y, x] = color
    return image
```
